///
/// The equation-of-state expansion shared across an edge, used by the
/// FiniteVolume pressure gradient.
///
/// Specific volume is never integrated directly. For each cell and layer it is
/// expanded to first order about a reference state,
///
///    alpha(Ct, Sa, p) = alpha0 + alphaCt (Ct - Ct0) + alphaSa (Sa - Sa0)
///                              + alphaP  (p  - p0)
///
/// with the four coefficients coming from a single equation-of-state
/// evaluation per cell per layer -- the SpecVol, SpecVolDCt, SpecVolDSa and
/// SpecVolDP fields Eos already computes. Because temperature and salinity are
/// reconstructed as low-order polynomials in pressure and the expansion is
/// linear in them, the expanded specific volume is a low-order polynomial in
/// pressure and every integral the scheme needs is available in closed form.
/// No equation-of-state evaluation occurs inside any integral, which is what
/// bounds the cost.
///
/// The expansion point and the coefficients are shared across each edge:
/// averaged from the edge's two cells and used for *both* columns. This is
/// what the robustness property rests on. Give each column its own expansion
/// point and the two columns describe the same water with two slightly
/// different approximations to the same equation of state, their alpha0 and
/// alphaP terms no longer cancel in the matched-pressure difference, and the
/// scheme generates spurious flow out of nothing but its own equation-of-state
/// approximation.
///
/// Note what is and is not load-bearing here. That *one* set multiplies both
/// columns is essential. *Which* set it is -- selected by edge layer, or by
/// some other rule -- is an ordinary accuracy question and cannot break
/// exactness, because the coefficients end up multiplying a quantity that is
/// identically zero on the exact set.
