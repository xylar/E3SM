///
/// Mean-preserving vertical reconstruction of conservative temperature and
/// absolute salinity in pressure, used by the FiniteVolume pressure gradient.
///
/// Within layer K of a column the prognostic layer mean is supplemented by a
/// deviation that integrates to zero over the layer,
///
///    Theta(p) = Theta_k + Slope_k * (p - PressureMid_k)
///
/// Phase 1 uses linear deviations, which makes the pressure gradient exact for
/// profiles that vary linearly with pressure. There is no limiter: the
/// reconstruction feeds an integral rather than an advective flux, and a
/// limiter active on smooth data would break the cancellation the scheme rests
/// on precisely where the profile is well resolved.
///
/// Two properties carry the weight.
///
/// Mean-preserving. PressureMid is the exact arithmetic midpoint of the two
/// interface pressures, so the integral of (p - PressureMid) over the layer is
/// zero and the deviation cannot move the layer mean. This is also what makes
/// VertCoord's midpoint rule the exact layer integral of a Phase 1
/// reconstruction, and hence what spares VertCoord any change.
///
/// Exact on a non-uniform grid. For a profile linear in pressure the layer
/// means lie exactly on the line as a function of mid-layer pressure, because
/// the mean of a linear function over a layer is its value at the layer's
/// midpoint. A centered difference of the layer means with respect to
/// PressureMid therefore recovers the slope exactly, for any distribution of
/// layer thicknesses. This is why the estimator differences against the actual
/// mid-layer pressures and not against layer index: a formula that assumed
/// uniform thickness would pass a uniform-thickness test and fail on Omega's
/// grid.
///
/// The functions here take scalars so that they can be unit tested without a
/// mesh.

/// that pressure, which under tilt is generally not layer K -- at a coordinate
/// tilt of 50 m/km with 64 m layers the two columns' layer K are offset by
/// nearly three layer thicknesses and do not overlap in pressure at all.
/// Looking a column's state up by layer index instead would silently
/// reintroduce the very error the scheme exists to remove, and would still
/// pass every exactness and accuracy check available, which is why the
/// property tests on this function are not optional.
///
/// Interface pressures increase downward, so the search walks up while Press
/// lies above the layer's top interface and down while it lies below the
/// bottom one. Within the column scan the answer advances monotonically with
/// K, so passing the previous answer as KHint makes this a pair of incremented
/// cursors rather than a search; the result does not depend on the hint.
///
/// Where Press lies outside the column altogether the outermost valid layer is
/// returned and its reconstruction is extrapolated. This is the rule at the
/// top and bottom of the column: the edge control volume's pressure range is
/// in general neither column's own, so near the sea floor a column's deepest
/// reconstruction must be evaluated slightly below its own floor. Exactness
/// survives extrapolation, because on the exact set an extrapolated
/// reconstruction still reproduces the true profile.
