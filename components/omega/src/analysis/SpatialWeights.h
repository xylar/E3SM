//
/// \file
/// \brief Defines the SpatialWeights class used by the spatial statistics
///
/// A global mean or standard deviation of a field must weight each mesh
/// entity by how much of the ocean it represents, or on a variable-resolution
/// mesh the statistic is biased toward wherever the cells are small.
/// SpatialWeights builds the weights for a reduction of a field over all of
/// its owned mesh entities and active layers:
///
/// - A horizontal field (rank 1) is weighted by the area of each entity:
///   AreaCell for cells, DcEdge times DvEdge for edges and AreaTriangle for
///   vertices, masked to active entities.
/// - A layered field (last dimension NVertLayers) is weighted by mass: the
///   entity area times the current PseudoThickness, which is the layer's
///   renormalized mass per unit area, masked to active layers. The
///   pseudo-thickness is the mean of the two cells on an edge and the
///   kite-area-weighted mean of the cells on a vertex, as in the auxiliary
///   variables.
/// - An interface field (last dimension NVertLayersP1) is weighted by half
///   the mass of each adjacent active layer, so the weights sum to the
///   column mass and the result is the mass-weighted mean of the field taken
///   as piecewise linear between interfaces.
///
/// Only active entries take part: the weights are built from the active
/// masks by selection rather than multiplication, and the reductions skip
/// inactive entries, so the fill values in inactive layers are never read.
/// Area weights are constant and computed once. Mass weights depend on the
/// state and are recomputed by update() before each reduction. The weighted
/// sums accumulate each owned entity's contribution over its layers and any
/// leading extra dimensions (e.g. tracers) in a fixed order and pass the
/// per-entity terms to globalSum, so they are as reproducible as Omega's
/// other global sums.
