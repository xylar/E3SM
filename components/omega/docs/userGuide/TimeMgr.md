# Time Manager (TimeMgr)

Users will ultimately utilize the Time Manager to control run duration,
output variables and frequency, forcing data input, etc. via parameters
defined in YAML configuration files. Details for this are to be determined,
see the [Time Manager developer's guide](#omega-dev-time-manager) for a more
comprehensive description of the Time Manager in the meantime.
