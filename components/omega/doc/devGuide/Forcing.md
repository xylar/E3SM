# Forcing

This page describes design and implementation details for forcing-related
pathways in Omega, currently this includes:

- Surface stress forcing (e.g. wind stress)
- Surface thickness and tracer flux forcing (actively coupled or data-forced)
- Surface tracer restoring (soon to be ported as a field originating from the coupler)

## Surface stress forcing design

### Surface stress forcing data flow

1. External fields provide:
   - `SfcStressZonal`
   - `SfcStressMeridional`
2. Forcing compute builds `NormalStressEdge` from those fields.
3. Tendency term applies surface stress forcing to edge-normal velocity tendency.

### Surface stress forcing key classes/components

- `SfcStressForcingVars`
  - Stores surface stress cell fields and computed `NormalStressEdge`
  - Applies configured interpolation choice (`InterpType`)
- `Forcing`
  - Calls `SfcStressForcingVars::computeVarsOnEdge` from
    `computeSfcStressForcingOnEdge`
- `SfcStressForcingOnEdge` tendency term
  - Adds contribution proportional to normal stress and inverse layer
    thickness in the surface layer

### Surface stress forcing config coupling

- `Omega.SfcStress.InterpType`
  - mapped to `InterpCellToEdgeOption`
- `Omega.Tendencies.SfcStressForcingTendencyEnable`
  - gates execution of surface stress forcing tendency kernel

## Surface thickness and tracer flux forcing design

### Surface thickness and tracer flux forcing data flow

**Thickness equation pathway:**

1. External fields provide freshwater and salt flux components:
   - `SnowFlux`, `RainFlux`, `EvaporationFlux`
   - `SeaIceFreshWaterFlux`, `IceRunoffFlux`, `RiverRunoffFlux`
   - `SeaIceSaltFlux`
2. `Forcing` stores the flux fields in `TracerForcingVars`
3. The tendency term `SfcThicknessForcingOnCell` sums the freshwater and salt mass fluxes and applies them to
the surface layer pseudo-thickness.

**Tracer equation pathway:**

1. External fields provide heat and salt flux components:
   - `LatentHeatFluxEvap`, `SensibleHeatFlux`
   - `LongWaveHeatFluxUp`, `LongWaveHeatFluxDown`
   - `SeaIceHeatFlux`, `ShortWaveHeatFlux`
   - mass fluxes which add energy changes (`SnowFlux`, `RainFlux`, `IceRunoffFlux`, `RiverRunoffFlux`)
   - `SeaIceSaltFlux`
2. `Forcing` stores the flux fields in `TracerForcingVars`
3. The tendency term `SfcTracerForcingOnCell` converts the summed external heat fluxes to a conservative-temperature tendency,
  and applies the external sea-ice salt flux to the top layer salt content thus impacting salinity.

### Surface thickness and tracer flux forcing key classes/components

- `TracerForcingVars`
  - Stores 13 coupled flux cell-centered fields: 6 freshwater fluxes, 6 heat
    fluxes, and 1 salt flux component
  - Fields initialized to zero and registered in `Forcing` field group
  - Stores `SurfaceTracerFlux[NTracers, NCells]`, the unified forcing input
    for KPP non-local tracer mixing. External forcing supplies every
    non-temperature/salinity tracer flux explicitly; an explicit zero is a
    valid flux. KPP derives temperature and salinity from the heat and mass
    flux components and overwrites those two entries before using the field.
- `SfcThicknessForcingOnCell` tendency term
  - Computes the layer mass contribution (converted to pseudo-thickness): $\sum (\text{SnowFlux} + \text{RainFlux} + \text{EvaporationFlux} + \text{SeaIceFreshWaterFlux} + \text{IceRunoffFlux} + \text{RiverRunoffFlux} + \text{SeaIceSaltFlux}) / \rho_{sw}$
  - Applied only at surface layer (top active layer) using `MinLayerCell`
- `SfcTracerForcingOnCell` tendency term
  - For temperature: adds the direct heat fluxes
    Q_{\text{sensible}} + Q_{\text{lw,up}} + Q_{\text{lw,down}} + Q_{\text{sw}}$,
    the enthalpy flux from sea-ice interactions (conduction, phase-change and enthalpy of mass flux)  Q_{\text{ice}}, the enthalpy of added freshwater mass $(\text{RainFlux} + \text{RiverRunoffFlux}) c^0_{p,sw} max(C_T(0,0,0),C_T^{\text{top}})$ (freshwater $T >= 0$), the evaporation terms ($Q_{\text{latentEvap}} + EvapFlux c^0_{p,sw} C_T^{\text{top}})
, the enthalpy change for frozen mass $(\text{SnowFlux} + \text{IceRunoffFlux}) PotEnthalpyIce$, where PotEnthalpyIce is the potential enthalpy of solid ice (which includes phase change and enthalpy of the melted mass). To first order, $PotEnthalpyIce$ is approximated by $-LatIce$, the engineering handbook value, neglecting 0.1%.
    These potential enthalpy terms are then scaled by $H_{\text{FluxFac}}$ to provide the layer tracer tendency.
  - For salinity: applies the mass salt flux with the appropriate unit conversion: $\text{SeaIceSaltFlux} \times S_{\text{FluxFac}}$
  - Applied only at surface layer using `MinLayerCell`
  - Uses tracer index validation to apply to specific tracers only
- `Forcing`
  - Manages `TracerForcingVars` instance
- `Tendencies`
  - Calls `SfcThicknessForcingOnCell` in `computePseudoThicknessTendenciesOnly`
  - Calls `SfcTracerForcingOnCell` in `computeTracerTendenciesOnly` after surface tracer restoring

### Surface thickness and tracer flux forcing config coupling

- `Omega.Tendencies.SfcThicknessForcingTendencyEnable`
  - gates execution of coupled flux thickness kernel
  - controls freshwater and salt flux forcing on sea surface height
- `Omega.Tendencies.SfcTracerForcingTendencyEnable`
  - gates execution of coupled flux tracer kernel
  - controls direct heat flux forcing on temperature and salt flux forcing on salinity

## Notes

- Currently all forcing is applied to the surface layer only. In the future, vertical spreading of river runoff contributions will be needed.
- `SeaIceFreshWaterFlux` is the pure freshwater mass from sea ice. The full mass flux from sea ice is `SeaIceFreshWaterFlux + SeaIceSaltFlux`
- When `TracerNonLocalFluxTendencyEnable` is true, every active
  `SurfaceTracerFlux` entry must be supplied for the current forcing step.
  KPP validates this after inserting its temperature and salinity fluxes and
  aborts if an active entry retains its fill value. This prevents a missing
  carbon or passive-tracer flux from becoming a non-local tendency.
- Coupled callers update the full field with `Forcing::setSurfaceTracerFlux`.
  They supply every non-temperature/salinity entry; KPP overwrites the two
  reserved temperature and salinity entries. Partial non-temperature/salinity
  updates are not supported, so omitted values cannot persist from a previous
  forcing step.

## Surface tracer restoring design

### Surface tracer restoring data flow

1. External fields provide target values: `TracersMonthlySurfClimoCell` (values and units should match the state variables)
2. Auxiliary-state compute forms restoring differences: `SurfTracerRestoringDiffsCell = target - tracer_surface`
3. Tendency term applies restoring only at surface layer and only for tracers selected from `SurfaceRestoring.TracersToRestore`.

### Surface tracer restoring key classes/components

- `SurfTracerRestAuxVars`
  - Inputs: `TracersMonthlySurfClimoCell`, tracer state array
  - Output: `SurfTracerRestoringDiffsCell`
  - Uses `MinLayerCell` to select surface layer index
- `SurfaceTracerRestoringOnCell` tendency term
  - Applies `PistonVelocity * SurfTracerRestoringDiffsCell` at surface
- `Tendencies`
  - Parses `SurfaceRestoring.TracersToRestore` and resolves tracer indices
  - Builds `TracerIdsToRestore` and `NTracersToRestore`
  - Applies tracer-selection logic at call site in
    `computeTracerTendenciesOnly`
  - Aborts if restoring is enabled but no tracer IDs are available

### Surface tracer restoring config coupling

- `Omega.SurfaceRestoring.PistonVelocity`
  - tendency scaling
- `Omega.SurfaceRestoring.TracersToRestore`
  - tracer-level enable list used to build `TracerIdsToRestore`
- `Omega.Tendencies.SurfaceTracerRestoringEnable`
  - gates restoring tendency execution

## Notes

- If a tracer is not listed in `TracersToRestore`, no restoring tendency is applied to that tracer.
- If restoring is enabled but no tracer IDs are available at tendency compute-time, Omega aborts with an error.
- It is assumed that the incoming `TracersMonthlySurfClimoCell` fields (values and units) match the Omega state variables (i.e. conservative temperature and absolute salinity for Teos-10). If not, a pre-processing conversion should be implemented.
- Surface tracer restoring is active everywhere if enabled. A flag to turn it off under sea ice will need to be added in later development if this feature is desired.
- Unlike MPAS-Ocean, a `MaxDiff` clamping is not applied here. This check should instead be implemented in Ocean Validate when that is available.
- A global scaling to ensure zero-sum has not been implemented for the surface tracer restoring, but should be added in later development.
- At this stage, there is no temporal interpolation applied to the restoring targets, the raw `TracersMonthlySurfClimoCell` snapshot is used.
