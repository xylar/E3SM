# MPAS Mesh Specification

## Summary

This document describes the required fields for an MPAS mesh. In addition, it
defines required orderings when creating an MPAS mesh. These together fully
describe the MPAS mesh type and allow users to more easily understand what
makes an MPAS mesh.

The vertical coordinate and related variables and attributes are added after
mesh creation and are not addressed in this document.

## Definitions and conventions

The meshes used by MPAS are Voronoi tessellations (VTs), in which MPAS
identifies three types of elements: *cells*, *edges*, and *vertices*. Cells are
simply the Voronoi cells in the tessellation, edges are the boundaries between
adjacent Voronoi cells, and vertices are the corners of cells. In MPAS, cells
are nominally located at the Voronoi generating points, which, for centroidal
Voronoi tessellations, are the mass centroids of the Voronoi cells with respect
to a density function, and edges are nominally located at the midpoints of
edges. {numref}`fig-three-cell` shows three cells with their associated edges
and vertices.

orange triangles, and vertices by red squares.
```

The VT meshes used by MPAS may be defined on the Cartesian plane or on a
sphere. In the case of planar meshes, areas and distances are assumed to be
Euclidean, and the mesh is defined on the plane $z = 0$. On a planar mesh,
eastward is the $x$ direction and northward is the $y$ direction.

In the case of spherical meshes, areas and distances are computed in spherical
geometry; cells, edges, and vertices are constrained to lie on the surface of
the sphere, and the sphere is centered at the origin, $(x,y,z) = (0,0,0)$. In
all cases, the coordinate systems assumed by MPAS meshes are right-handed.
{numref}`fig-voronoi-examples` illustrates VT meshes on the Cartesian plane and
on the sphere. There are no requirements for the radius of the sphere, however
an attribute `sphere_radius` is required that defines the radius of the sphere.

## Grid description

The MPAS grid system requires the definition of seven elements. These seven
elements are composed of two types of *cells*, two types of *lines*, and three
types of *points*. These elements are depicted in {numref}`fig-variable-position`
and defined in {numref}`tab-variable-position`. These elements can be defined on
either the plane or the surface of the sphere. The two types of cells form two
meshes, a primal mesh composed of Voronoi regions and a dual mesh composed of
Delaunay triangles. Each corner of a primal mesh cell is uniquely associated
with the "center" of a dual mesh cell and vice versa. So we define the two mesh
as either a primal mesh (composed of cells $P_i$) or a dual mesh (composed of
cells $D_v$). The center of any primal mesh cell, $P_i$, is denoted by
${\bf x}_i$ and the center of any dual mesh cell, $D_v$, is denoted by
${\bf x}_v$. The boundary of a given primal mesh cell $P_i$ is composed of the
set of lines that connect the ${\bf x}_v$ locations of associated dual mesh
cells $D_v$. Similarly, the boundary of a given dual mesh cell $D_v$ is composed
of the set of lines that connect the ${\bf x}_i$ locations of the associated
primal mesh cells $P_i$.

As shown in {numref}`fig-variable-position`, a line segment that connects two
primal mesh cell centers is uniquely associated with a line segment that
connects two dual mesh cell centers. We assume that these two line segments
cross and the point of intersection is labeled as ${\bf x}_e$. In addition, we
assume that these two line segments are orthogonal as indicated in
{numref}`fig-variable-position`. Each ${\bf x}_e$ is associated with two
distances: $d_e$ measures the distance between the primal mesh cells sharing
${\bf x}_e$ and $l_e$ measures the distance between the dual mesh cells sharing
${\bf x}_e$.

Since the two line segments crossing at ${\bf x}_e$ are orthogonal, these line
segments form a convenient local coordinate system for each edge. At each
${\bf x}_e$ location a unit vector ${\bf n}_e$ is defined to be parallel to the
line connecting primal mesh cells. A second unit vector ${\bf t}_e$ is defined
such that ${\bf t}_e = {\bf k} \times {\bf n}_e$.

In addition to these seven element types, we require the definition of *sets of
elements*. In all, eight different types of sets are required and these are
defined and explained in {numref}`tab-grid-connectivity` and
{numref}`fig-grid-connectivity`. The notation is always of the form of, for
example, $i \in CE(e)$, where the LHS indicates the type of element to be
gathered (cells) based on the RHS relation to another type of element (edges).

{numref}`tab-grid-variables` provides the names of all *elements* and all *sets
of elements* as used in the MPAS framework. Elements appear twice in the table
when described in the grid file in more than one way, e.g. points are described
with both Cartesian and latitude/longitude coordinates.

An `ncdump -h` of an MPAS mesh, output, or restart file should contain the
mesh-variable names listed in {numref}`tab-grid-variables`.

## Horizontal mesh fields

The **Read by** column indicates how Omega obtains each field:

- `HorzMeshIn` — read from the mesh file by the `HorzMeshIn` I/O stream and
  field group, which are defined by the `HorzMesh` class.
- `Decomp` — read and redistributed by the `Decomp` class before `HorzMesh` is
  constructed. These arrays hold local addresses that depend on the domain
  decomposition, so they are neither read nor written by `HorzMesh`.
- `—` — not read by Omega.

conventions:

|--------|----------------------------|
| `latCell`, `latEdge`, `latVertex` | $-\pi/2 \leq \mathrm{latitude} \leq \pi/2$ |
| `lonCell`, `lonEdge`, `lonVertex` | $0 \leq \mathrm{longitude} \leq 2\pi$ |
| All latitude and longitude fields on a planar mesh | Constant value of 0 |

(edge-angles)=

## Edge angles

`angleEdge` may be defined equivalently as the angle that the positive normal
direction $\vec{u}$ makes with the local eastward direction (shown in
{ref}`fig-angle-edge`), or as the angle that the positive tangential direction
$\vec{v}$ makes with the local northward direction.

```{figure} images/angleEdge.png
:name: fig-angle-edge
:align: center
:height: 350px

Definition of `angleEdge`, the angle between the positive normal direction
$\vec{u}$ and the local eastward direction. Equivalently, it is the angle
```

### Reference formulations

Two equivalent formulations are used in practice. Both satisfy the definition
above, but the former was found to be more accurate on spherical meshes.

#### Normal-and-east formulation

Let $\hat{\mathbf{e}}$ and $\hat{\mathbf{n}}$ be the local eastward and
northward unit vectors at ${\bf x}_e$,

$$
\hat{\mathbf{e}} =
\frac{\hat{\mathbf{k}} \times {\bf x}_e}{\|\hat{\mathbf{k}} \times {\bf x}_e\|},
\qquad
\hat{\mathbf{n}} =
\frac{{\bf x}_e \times \hat{\mathbf{e}}}{\|{\bf x}_e \times \hat{\mathbf{e}}\|},
$$

where $\hat{\mathbf{k}}$ is the Cartesian $z$ axis. The edge-normal direction is
recovered from the tangential vector as
$\vec{u} \propto \vec{v} \times {\bf x}_e$, and its eastward and northward
components are

$$
u_e = \left(\vec{v} \times {\bf x}_e\right) \cdot \hat{\mathbf{e}},
\qquad
u_n = \left(\vec{v} \times {\bf x}_e\right) \cdot \hat{\mathbf{n}}.
$$

The angle then follows directly from a two-argument arctangent,

$$
\mathrm{angleEdge} = \mathrm{atan2}\left(u_n,\, u_e\right),
$$

which returns a value in $(-\pi, \pi]$. This formulation is used by the Polaris
spherical base-mesh step.

#### Tangential-and-north formulation

Equivalently, the angle may be obtained from the change in latitude along the
edge. On the unit sphere,

$$
\alpha = \arccos\left(
\mathrm{clamp}\left(
\frac{\mathrm{lat}_{v_2} - \mathrm{lat}_{v_1}}{l_e},\, -1,\, 1
\right)\right),
$$

where $l_e$ is `dvEdge` expressed on the unit sphere, that is, `dvEdge` divided
by `sphere_radius`. Because $\arccos$ is even, this yields only the magnitude of
the angle; the sign is taken from the orientation of
$\mathbf{x}_{v_2}$ relative to a reference point displaced slightly northward
from ${\bf x}_e$, and the result is then wrapped into $[-\pi, \pi]$,

$$
\mathrm{angleEdge} =
\left(s\,\alpha + \pi \bmod 2\pi\right) - \pi,
\qquad
s = \pm 1 .
$$

This formulation is used by `MpasMeshConverter.x`.

On a planar mesh, both formulations reduce to the angle between the
edge-normal vector and the $x$ axis,

$$
\mathrm{angleEdge} =
\begin{cases}
\theta, & u_y \geq 0 \\
2\pi - \theta, & u_y < 0
\end{cases}
\qquad
\theta = \arccos\left(\frac{u_x}{\|\vec{u}\|}\right),
$$

with $\vec{u}$ evaluated after any periodic adjustment of
$\mathbf{x}_{\mathrm{cellsOnEdge}(2,\mathrm{iEdge})}$ relative to
$\mathbf{x}_{\mathrm{cellsOnEdge}(1,\mathrm{iEdge})}$.

### Recovering earth-relative vectors

Given a vector $(u_\perp, u_\parallel)$ defined in terms of components
orthogonal to and parallel to the edge, the earth-relative components $(u,v)$
in the local eastward and northward directions are

$$
\begin{bmatrix}
u \\
v \\
\end{bmatrix}
=
\begin{bmatrix}
\cos\alpha & -\sin\alpha \\
\sin\alpha & \cos\alpha \\
\end{bmatrix}
\begin{bmatrix}
u_\perp \\
u_\parallel \\
\end{bmatrix},
$$

where $\alpha = {\rm angleEdge}$. This relation holds for either reference
formulation, since it depends on $\alpha$ only through $\cos\alpha$ and
$\sin\alpha$.

## Global attributes

The following global attributes are required by the MPAS framework. All MPAS
meshes should contain these global attributes.

| Attribute       | Type      | Valid values                                  | Description |
|-----------------|-----------|-----------------------------------------------|-------------|
| `on_a_sphere`   | character | `"YES"` or `"NO"`                             | Defines whether the mesh describes points that lie on the surface of a sphere. |
| `sphere_radius` | double    | any non-negative real value                   | Radius of the sphere the points are defined on. Set to 0 for a planar mesh. |
| `is_periodic`   | character | `"YES"` or `"NO"`                             | Defines whether the mesh has any periodic boundaries. Only meaningful when `on_a_sphere` is `"NO"`. |
| `mesh_spec`     | character | any valid version of the MPAS mesh specification | Version of the MPAS mesh specification the mesh conforms to. |
| `file_id`       | character | any combination of lowercase letters and numbers | Random string used for tracking mesh provenance. |
| `parent_id`     | character | one or more `file_id` values, newline separated | Provenance chain of the files this mesh was derived from. |
| `Conventions`   | character | `"MPAS"`                                      | Identifies the file as following MPAS conventions. |
| `source`        | character | name of the generating tool                   | Tool that produced the mesh, e.g. `MpasMeshConverter.x`. |
| `history`       | character | free text                                     | Command line used to produce the mesh, prepended to any inherited history. |

When `is_periodic` is set to `"YES"`, the following two attributes are required
as well:

| Attribute  | Type   | Valid values            | Description |
|------------|--------|-------------------------|-------------|
| `x_period` | double | any positive real value | Period of the mesh in the $x$ direction. |
| `y_period` | double | any positive real value | Period of the mesh in the $y$ direction. |

(connectivity-ordering-requirements)=

## Connectivity and ordering requirements

Connectivity arrays that describe corresponding elements must use consistent
ordering. For example, `edgesOnCell(n, iCell)` must identify the edge between
`iCell` and `cellsOnCell(n, iCell)`.

When creating an MPAS mesh, it is recommended to establish connectivity and
ordering relative to edges first, then vertices, and finally cells.

### Missing values and padding

A mesh may contain a cell with no neighbor across one or more edges, such as an
ocean mesh from which land cells have been removed. In this case, the missing
entry in a connectivity array such as `cellsOnCell` must be represented by 0.

Connectivity arrays also need padding when an element has fewer entries than
the corresponding maximum dimension. For example, if a mesh contains a
heptagon, `maxEdges` is 7, while hexagons and pentagons have only 6 and 5 valid
entries. MPAS itself does not prescribe the padding values, and reference mesh
generation tools pad with zeros. Some external tools instead require repetition
of the final valid entry. Use a convention that is consistent across the
complete tool chain.

### Requirements relative to edges

The edge-normal and tangential vectors and the `angleEdge` convention are
defined in {ref}`edge-angles`. In addition, the edge connectivity arrays must
satisfy the following ordering requirements:

- `edgesOnEdge` must proceed counter-clockwise, beginning with the edges that
  surround `cellsOnEdge(1, iEdge)` and ending with the edges that surround
  `cellsOnEdge(2, iEdge)`.
- The current edge is omitted from `edgesOnEdge`, but it may be treated as both
  the starting and ending location when checking counter-clockwise ordering.
- `weightsOnEdge` must use exactly the same ordering as `edgesOnEdge`; thus,
  `weightsOnEdge(n, iEdge)` applies to `edgesOnEdge(n, iEdge)`. The weights are
  those of the TRiSK formulation of Thuburn et al., *J. Comput. Phys.*, 2009,
  and depend on `dcEdge`, `dvEdge`, `areaCell`, and `kiteAreasOnVertex`.

Counter-clockwise ordering of `edgesOnEdge` around the two cells that share an
edge.
```

### Requirements relative to vertices

- `cellsOnVertex` and `edgesOnVertex` must proceed counter-clockwise around a
  vertex.
- Cells and edges alternate around a vertex, with
  `cellsOnVertex(n, iVertex)` lying counter-clockwise of
  `edgesOnVertex(n, iVertex)` and clockwise of `edgesOnVertex(n+1, iVertex)`.
  For every valid $n$, the vector

  $$
  \left(\mathbf{x}_{\mathrm{edgesOnVertex}(n,\mathrm{iVertex})}
  - \mathbf{x}_{\mathrm{iVertex}}\right)
  \times
  \left(\mathbf{x}_{\mathrm{cellsOnVertex}(n,\mathrm{iVertex})}
  - \mathbf{x}_{\mathrm{iVertex}}\right)
  $$

  must point in the local outward-normal direction. The indices in this
  expression represent their corresponding Cartesian position vectors.

  This has the same sense as the corresponding requirement relative to cells
  below, where `verticesOnCell(n, iCell)` likewise lies counter-clockwise of
  `edgesOnCell(n, iCell)`.

- `kiteAreasOnVertex(n, iVertex)` is the intersection of
  `areaTriangle(iVertex)` with
  `areaCell(cellsOnVertex(n, iVertex))`. It follows from the ordering above
  that this kite is the quadrilateral bounded by `iVertex`,
  `edgesOnVertex(n, iVertex)`, `cellsOnVertex(n, iVertex)`, and
  `edgesOnVertex(n+1, iVertex)`, where the edge index wraps back to 1 for the
  last kite.

### Requirements relative to cells

- `cellsOnCell`, `edgesOnCell`, and `verticesOnCell` must each proceed
  counter-clockwise around a cell.
- `edgesOnCell(n, iCell)` must be the edge between `iCell` and
  `cellsOnCell(n, iCell)`.
- `verticesOnCell(n, iCell)` must lead both `edgesOnCell(n, iCell)` and
  `cellsOnCell(n, iCell)`. For every valid $n$, the vector

  $$
  \left(\mathbf{x}_{\mathrm{edgesOnCell}(n,\mathrm{iCell})}
  - \mathbf{x}_{\mathrm{iCell}}\right)
  \times
  \left(\mathbf{x}_{\mathrm{verticesOnCell}(n,\mathrm{iCell})}
  - \mathbf{x}_{\mathrm{iCell}}\right)
  $$

  must point in the local outward-normal direction. The same requirement holds
  when `cellsOnCell` is substituted for `edgesOnCell`. The indices in these
  expressions represent their corresponding Cartesian position vectors.

### Boundary representation

Some meshes need to represent boundaries between active and inactive regions,
between ocean and land, or between a nested mesh and its parent mesh. A
boundary edge is represented through `cellsOnEdge`: when the second entry,
`cellsOnEdge(2, iEdge)`, is 0, the edge is treated as a boundary edge.

### Optional and diagnostic fields

The following fields are not required by this specification. Some are written by
mesh-generation tools as diagnostics, and others are commonly computed
internally by MPAS cores.

| Field | Read by | Description |
|-------|---------|-------------|
| `int boundaryVertex(nVertices)` | — | 1 if the vertex has fewer than `vertexDegree` valid cells, 0 otherwise |
| `double cellQuality(nCells)` | — | Ratio of the minimum to maximum `dvEdge` on each cell |
| `double gridSpacing(nCells)` | — | Mean `dcEdge` over the edges of each cell |
| `double triangleQuality(nVertices)` | — | Ratio of the minimum to maximum `dcEdge` on each dual cell |
| `double triangleAngleQuality(nVertices)` | — | Ratio of the minimum to maximum interior angle of each dual triangle |
| `int obtuseTriangle(nVertices)` | — | 1 if the dual triangle contains an obtuse angle, 0 otherwise |
| `double edgeNormalVectors(nEdges, R3)` | — | Vectors in Cartesian space normal to each edge |
| `double localVerticalUnitVectors(nCells, R3)` | — | Vectors in Cartesian space pointing in the local vertical direction at cell centers |
| `double cellTangentPlane(nCells, TWO, R3)` | — | Two orthonormal vectors in the tangent plane of each cell |
| `double fCell(nCells)` | `HorzMeshIn` | Coriolis parameter at cell centers (radians s-1) |
| `double fEdge(nEdges)` | `HorzMeshIn` | Coriolis parameter at edges (radians s-1) |
| `double fVertex(nVertices)` | `HorzMeshIn` | Coriolis parameter at vertices (radians s-1) |
