This testdef is used to test the conservation check analysis member, which
wasintroduced in MPAS-Ocean PR #4521 and has been made a stealth feature in
#6643. This test turns on the consevation check analysis member by setting:

    config_AM_conservationCheck_enable = .true.

Then, it enables the use of MPAS-Ocean history files in testing by running
a sed command to modify env_archive.xml.
