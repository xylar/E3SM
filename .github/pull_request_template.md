  <!--
  Remove rows for any machine/compiler combinations you do not plan to run (or ask someone else to run).
  PRs are expected to pass tests on at least one CPU and at least one GPU platform for both standalone
  tests (CTests and omega_pr) and coupled CIME tests.

[^1]: Remove rows for any configurations you do not run (or ask someone else to run).
    At a minimum, PRs are expected to pass tests on at least one CPU and at least one GPU platform for both standalone tests (CTests and `omega_pr`) and coupled CIME tests.

* [ ] Provide relevant details in a comment to the PR titled `Testing` with the following:
  * Which machines [CTest unit tests](https://docs.e3sm.org/Omega/Omega/devGuide/QuickStart.html#running-ctests)
        have been run on and indicate that are all passing.
  * The [Polaris omega_pr test suite](https://docs.e3sm.org/Omega/Omega/devGuide/Testing.html)
     has passed, using the Polaris `e3sm_submodules/Omega` baseline
  * Document machine(s), compiler(s), and the build path(s) used for `-p` for both the baseline (Polaris `e3sm_submodules/Omega`) and the PR build
  * Which [coupled CIME tests](https://docs.e3sm.org/Omega/Omega/devGuide/Testing.html#coupled-testing-with-cime)
     (such as `ERS_D` or `PEM_D` tests) have been run and indicate that they are all passing
  * Indicate "All tests passed" or document failing tests
  * Document testing used to verify the changes including any tests that are added/modified/impacted.
* [ ] Performance related PRs: Please include a relevant PACE experiment link documenting performance before and after.
* [ ] New tests:
  * [ ] CTest unit tests for new features have been added per the approved design.
  * [ ] Polaris tests for new features have been added per the approved design (and included in a test suite)
* Stealth Features
  * [ ] If any stealth features are included in the PR, please confirm that they have been documented.
